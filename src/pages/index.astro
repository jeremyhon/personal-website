					I’ve stayed hands-on throughout, not out of preference for control, but because the company

					<h2>StaffAny — Co-Founder &amp; CTO</h2>
					<p>Singapore · 2018–Present</p>
				</div>
				<div class="card">
					<p>
						StaffAny is a B2B workforce management platform serving roughly 70k monthly active users across
						~500 customer organizations. The product sits somewhere between mission-critical and
						business-as-usual essential: when it goes down, operations and payroll stop.
					</p>
					<p>
						At peak, the business reached low seven-figure SGD ARR. Over time, the company went through
						several distinct phases, each of which shaped how I operate as a technical leader.

						<h4>Payroll module (Q4 2023 → Q1 2024)</h4>
						<p>
							By late 2023, the company needed a step-change within a single quarter. Payroll emerged as
							the clearest strategic focus, but the scope was realistically a two-quarter build.
						</p>
						<p>
							My role was not to choose payroll, but to push hard for an aggressive delivery timeline
							anyway. To make this feasible, I drove a series of scope and sequencing decisions:
						</p>
						<ul class="facts">
							<li>Ruthlessly cut non-essential features</li>
							<li>Built onboarding first to allow pilot customers before full payroll rollout</li>
							<li>Accepted iteration post-launch rather than blocking on completeness</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The module launched on time in Q1 2024 and was iterated on rapidly thereafter. Over the
							following months, payroll was adopted by ~50% of the customer base, customer churn dropped
							from ~20% to ~10%, and payroll now contributes ~20–30% of revenue.
						</p>
					</article>

					<article class="card">
						<h4>Internal ERP / billing system</h4>
						<p>
							For a long time, revenue tracking depended on spreadsheets manually maintained by the
							revenue team. As part of the Series A process, we were mandated to move off spreadsheets.
							An Oracle NetSuite quote came in at roughly SGD 50k, which felt disproportionate to our
							needs and stage.
						</p>
						<p>
							I pushed to build a custom internal system that integrated HubSpot, Stripe, and product
							data. Delivered with roughly 0.5–1.5 engineers, it is purpose-built for our workflows
							rather than generic ERP abstractions. The system now handles contract signing, billing
							logic, and real-time revenue visibility.
						</p>
					</article>

					<article class="card">
						<h4>Phone-number authentication via WhatsApp</h4>
						<p>
							Our user base is heavily phone-number-centric. We relied on Firebase SMS authentication,
							which worked in Singapore but became extremely costly in Malaysia and Indonesia.
						</p>
						<p>
							I built a phone-number authentication system that uses WhatsApp as a first-class auth
							channel, routes by country, and automatically falls back between WhatsApp and SMS on
							delivery failure.
						</p>
						<p>
							The result: authentication spend reduced by ~10×, delivery rates comparable to SMS-only
							flows, and no regression in user experience.
						</p>
					</article>

					<article class="card">
						<h4>Cost cutting &amp; efficiency</h4>
						<p>
							During a broader cost-cutting push, I noticed our BigQuery spend growing into the low
							thousands per month despite relatively low query volume. After identifying the root
							cause, we fixed it immediately.
						</p>
						<p>
							The fix reduced BigQuery costs by ~90% overnight and kicked off a broader infrastructure
							review, resulting in roughly a 50% reduction in total cloud spend without meaningful
							degradation in reliability or performance.
